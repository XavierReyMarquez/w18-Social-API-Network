## General info

This application uses MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the unstructured data of a social network website. User information can be created, updated, and deleted and users can post thoughts. These thoughts can be created, updated, and deleted and can have reactions by other users. Users can also add and delete freinds.

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Video Walkthrough

The video walkthrough demonstrates the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for the users and thoughts. It also demonstrates the POST and DELETE methods for reactions and friend lists.
